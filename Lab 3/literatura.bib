   abstract = {In this study, a two-dimensional analytical model has been presented for coaxial magnetic gears. Based on Maxwell's equations the extracted model has been obtained via the solution of the Laplace and Poisson equations by using the separation of variable technique for each sub-region (internal and external magnets, internal and external air gaps and slots). Then the integral coefficients of the general solutions have been obtained by using the boundary conditions and continuity between sub-regions. The proposed analytical model can be used as a tool for design and optimisation of magnetic gears. The influences of the number of pole-pairs, the magnetisation patterns, the size of slot-opening and the segment ratio of the two-segment Halbach pattern on the transmitted torque and unbalanced magnetic forces have been analytically investigated. Finally, to illustrate the efficacy of the proposed model, the analytical results of the magnetic field distribution, transmitted torque and unbalanced magnetic force have been compared with those obtained from finite element analyses.},

   abstract = {Published work on metallic gear wear focuses, almost exclusively, on gears operating under normal, lubricated conditions. There are instances however, when it is desirable to run gears in a dry, unlubricated state. In these cases it is usual to employ non-metallic, polymer gears. This study was made to evaluate the performance of metal involute spur gears running under dry, unlubricated conditions. The stock (off the shelf) gears examined in this paper comprised mainly of carbon steel and spheroidal graphite iron but also included cast iron and aluminium bronze. A number of gears specially coated, inter alia, with molybdenum disulphide, electroless nickel, copper and lead/tin and various other specialised coatings by electro, chemical and physical vapour deposition were also tested for the purposes of comparison.},

   abstract = {One of the main gear damage mechanisms is the formation of pitting and spalling on the tooth flank. Several factors have significant influence on the damage formation, such as: contact stress level; tooth profile type; relative contact speed; surface finish and lubrication conditions. This work comprehends the global observation of all such parameters and was carried out to explain the phenomena related to this wear mechanism. The wear test equipment uses the power recirculation principle and is commonly known as FZG test rig. The gears were made from AISI 8620 steel and had two types of surface finishing (by shaving or by milling). The wear experiments were performed with two torque stages: 135 N.m (running-in) and 302 N.m (steady-state), and two test temperatures: 60°C (running-in) and 90°C (steady-state). The wear level was determined by using image analysis. In order to calculate the specific film thickness and friction coefficient, the roughness of tooth flank was measured at each test stop. After the experiments were completed, it was possible to confirm that, for both manufacturing processes, the boundary lubrication regime was adopted at the tooth flank and the specific film thickness presents a different behavior when compared to addendum, pitch diameter and deddendum regions. The wear on the gear flanks depended on the lubricant film thickness and it was higher for the milled gears. Copyright © 2012 by ABCM.},
